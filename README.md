# Skyhop Take Home SPA

- Attached is a mockup of a fictional screen. Create a react single page application that serves this page in the browser. The only requirement is that you make it look exactly like the mockup using react components, form fields and any other technology you think makes sense.

Extra credit:

- Make the drag & drop work to where I can put a file on the page and the filename pops up.

- Submit this assignment via a github link with multiple commits.

- Create a Demo link
